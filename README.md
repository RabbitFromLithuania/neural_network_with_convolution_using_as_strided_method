# ðŸ§  Neural Network with Convolution Using `as_strided` (NumPy)

This project showcases a custom implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using NumPy's `as_strided` method. The goal is to perform efficient 2D convolutions without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Custom CNN Implementation**: Built from scratch using NumPy, providing a deeper understanding of underlying operations.
- **Efficient Convolution**: Utilizes `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` for memory-efficient convolution operations.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed to reinforce concepts in deep learning by manually implementing core components.
